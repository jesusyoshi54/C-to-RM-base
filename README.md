# C to RM base
This is a fork of my base repo with makefile changes to not compress leveldata segments, and migrate them to segment 0xE.
This is meant to be used with a tool called C to RM which will extract these level data segments and plant them inside of
a RM rom.

# sm64ex_alo
Fork of [sm64pc/sm64ex](https://github.com/sm64pc/sm64ex/tree/nightly) with additional features. 

## Additional Pre reqs

 * pypng
 * bitstring

## Changes
 * Restored N64 build.
 * Additional backends merged from other forks (3DS, Wii U, Switch) (more incoming)

## Hackporting

This repo has been forked from sm64ex_alo to be optimized for porting romhacks from binary to every possible target.

Each branch of this repository should be a hack that has finished being ported or is currently being ported.

### Porting Tools

RM2C is the tool I developed to be able to port romhacks: [RM2C](https://gitlab.com/scuttlebugraiser/rom-manger-2-c)

When using the data from RM2C, make sure to set RM2C to 1 in the makefile.

### Changes to Master Branch

 * CI texture support
 * New Mario Model - by Yoshi Milkman
 * Custom version of Puppycam
 * Extended Bounds
 * Various Bugfixes
 * Skip Intro
 * Separated Custom Leveldata From Vanilla Leveldata
